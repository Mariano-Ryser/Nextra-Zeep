## Object-Oriented Programming in C++

Object- oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm
based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code that manipulates that data.

C++ supports OOP, and it involves kez concepts such as classes, objects,
inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.


## Classes and objects

A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines a data
structure by bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that
operate on the data.


### Vamos con algunos ejemplos.


```cpp filename="class.cpp" copy showLineNumbers // 
------ Defining a Class -------

class Rectangle {
    public:
        int width, height;

        int Area(){
            return width * height
        }
}

------ Creating Objects -------

int main(){
    Rectangle rect; //Create an object of Rectangle
    rect.width = 5;
    rect.height = 10;

    cout << "Area: " << rect.area() << endl; // Output: Area: 50
    return 0;
}

```

## Member Functions

Member functions are `Functions defined inside a class`.
They operate on the data members of the class.



```cpp filename="MemberFunctions.cpp" copy showLineNumbers /setDimensions/ 
------ Defining Meber Functions -------

class Rectangle {
public:
    int width, height;

    int area(){
        return width * height;
    }

    void setDimensions(int w, int h){
        width = w;
        height = h;
    }
}

------ Using Meber Functions -------

int main(){
    Rectangle rect;
    rect.setDimensions(5, 10);

    cout << "Area: " << rect.area() << endl; // Ouput Area: 50
    return 0;
}

```
What we did above, is to use the inner function of the rectangle to add the dimensions.
