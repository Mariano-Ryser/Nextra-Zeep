MongoDB

The MongoDB database is the foundation of MongoDB Atlas.
The additional functionality that Atlas offers—such as full-text search,
data visualization, data lake storage, and mobile device sync—are built
on top of data stored in cloud-hosted MongoDB database deployments.
 
MongoDB has a flexible schema model, which means that documents in the
same collection are not required to share a common structure of fields
and value types by default.

```js copy filename="example.js" showLineNumbers
{
  "username": "vreddy",
  "name": "Vasanti Reddy",
  "email": "vreddy1@gmail.com",
  "location": {
    "city": "Delhi",
    "country": "India"
  }
}

Add.. Social_media 

{
  "username": "avasa",
  "name": "Asad Vasa",
  "email": "avasa1@yahoo.com",
  "social_media": {
    "Twitter": "avasa",
    "Instagram": "Asad101",
    "LinkedIn": "AsadVasa"
  },
  "location": {
    "city": "Los Angeles",
    "country": "United States"
  }
}
